# Ecology Technology || 2022 Summer
Science Technology Entry Program 
Learn how to build the sensor technology to study science and ecology.  From weather sensors to animal camera traps, you will learn how to build, create, and install them in the wild.

### Introduction
This class will teach you the fundamentals of physical computing using microcomputers and sensors. This will lay the ground work for you to build a battery powered sensor kit that can be install in the field.  You will learn Arduino Software (IDE), and arduino based microcontrollers, and ESP32 Feather.
